Hi there! I'm a data analyst and researcher based in Madrid. I'm currently coursing the IRONHACK Data Analytics bootcamp.
You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ordovaspascual/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NachOrdo), or even [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nachordop/) for data unrelated stuff.
